                                info: ("1. READ together as a daily, fun, family activity. The AAP recommends this to build language, literacy, and social-emotional skills that last a lifetime.\n \nIt's never too young to start reading with your baby. Reading to your child, research suggests, boosts activity in parts of the brain that form the building blocks of language, literacy skills and imagination.\n \n 2. RHYME, play, talk, sing, and cuddle together oftenthroughout the day.\n \n  The AAP encourages parents to use play to help meet their child's health and developmental milestones, beginning from birth. Need ideas? Here are some great ways to do this based on your child's age. Talk with them about things they see around them, at home, at the store, or while traveling. Enroll in quality early education programs and activities, take time to visit a children's museum or local library, and enjoy story time.\n \n 3. Build ROUTINES for meals, play, and sleep.\n \n This helps children know what to expect and what is expected of them. Brush, Book, Bed, for example, is a great way to structure your child's nighttime routine. Eating at least three family meals together each week is associated with healthier kids, according to a study published in Pediatrics.\n \n 4. REWARD everyday successes (especially for effort toward goals like helping others).\n \n Catch your child doing something good and praise them for it! Praise from those closest to a child is a very powerful reward. Talk with your pediatrician about how to shape and manage your child's behavior, model the good behavior, and reinforce it by using positive discipline techniques that build a child's self-regulation skills. Your child's social, emotional, and behavior skills are equally critical to school success.\n \n 5. Develop RELATIONSHIPS that are nurturing, respectful, and consistent.\n \n A strong parent-child relationship helps protect against the lasting effects of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), traumatic situations that can lower a child's chance of doing well in school. As you strive to teach your child about healthy relationships and choosing friends wisely, don't forget to model them in your own life. Demonstrating good relationships skills with your spouse or partner, and taking time to nurture close friendships with others, is as important as simply talking about these skills--if not more so.\n \n  You are your baby's best teacher.\n\nA certain toy is not necessary for your child to reach his or her next developmental milestone. There is no one app that will teach your child to read. While it's easy to fall victim to the marketing, YOU are what your child needs to start on the path toward school readiness with daily reading, rhyming, routines, rewards, and relationship building."),

                                info: ("Adjusting Priorities\n\nJust as mothers occasionally need to readjust their priorities, fathers now have a golden opportunity to show more of their nurturing side by caring for Mom, the baby, and possibly other siblings. Although not all fathers have the option of paternity leave from work, those who do and take advantage of it may find it priceless. If Mom was the center of a sibling's universe and Dad was only an afterthought, Dad may suddenly be more 'cool' once a newborn comes home.\nBy adjusting his priorities (at home and at work) and 'rising to the occasion,' Dad can strengthen an already strong bond with Mom as well as with the new child. By working as a team, parenting couples may be amazed at how well they can adapt to their new, stressful circumstances.\n\nTeamwork\n\nOf course, balancing the seemingly constant demands of the baby, the needs of other children, and the household chores is not always easy. Nights spent feeding, diapering, and walking the floor with a crying baby can quickly take their toll in fatigue for both parents. But by working as a team to relieve each other for naps, for exercise, and for 'downtime,' parenting couples might find that even though they share less 'quality time' together, they may actually feel closer than ever. Sometimes there may be conflict and jealous feelings. These are normal, and thankfully, temporary. Life soon settles into a fairly regular routine that will once again give you some time to yourselves and restore your sex life and social activities to normal.\nMeanwhile, make an effort for just the two of you to spend some time together each day enjoying each other's company while the baby is sleeping or somebody else is caring for her. Remember, you're entitled to hold, hug, cuddle, and kiss each other as well as the baby.\n\nPlaying with Baby\n\nA positive way for men to deal with these issues is to become as involved as possible in caring for and playing with the new baby. When you spend this extra time with your child, you'll get just as emotionally attached to her as her mother will.\nThis is not to say that moms and dads play with babies the same way. In general, fathers play to arouse and excite their babies, while mothers generally concentrate on more low-key stimulation such as gentle rocking, quiet interactive games, singing, and soothing activities. From the baby's viewpoint, both play styles are equally valuable and complement each other beautifully, which is another reason why it's so important to have both of you involved in the care of the baby.

                          info: " Abdominal distension\n \n Most babies' bellies normally stick out, especially after a large feeding. Between feedings, however, they should feel soft. If your child's abdomen feels swollen and hard, and if she has not had a bowel movement for more than one or two days or is vomiting, call your pediatrician. Most likely the problem is due to gas or constipation, but it also could signal a more serious intestinal problem.\n\nBirth injuries \n Babies can be injured during birth, especially if labor is long or difficult, or when babies are very large. While newborns recover quickly from some of these injuries, others persist. Occasionally a broken collarbone occurs, which will heal quickly. After a few weeks a small lump may form at the fracture site, but don't be alarmed; this is a sign that new bone is forming to mend the injury, and it will soon be as good as new. \n Muscle weakness is another common birth injury during labor, caused by pressure or stretching of the nerves attached to the muscles. These muscles, usually weakened on one side of the face or one shoulder or arm, generally re­turn to normal after several weeks. In the meantime, ask your pediatrician to show you how to nurse and hold the baby to promote healing. \n \n Blue baby \n \n Babies may have mildly blue or purple hands and feet, which is usually normal. If their hands and feet turn slightly blue from cold, they should return to pink as soon as they are warm. Occasionally the face, tongue, and lips may turn a little blue when the newborn is crying hard, but once she is calm, her color should quickly return to normal. However, persistently blue skin coloring is a sign the heart or lungs are not operating properly. and the baby is not getting enough oxygen in the blood. Immediate medical attention is essential. \n \n Unusual bowel movements \n \n Meconium. After birth, the staff will watch for your baby's first urination and bowel movement to make sure she has no problem with these important tasks. It may be delayed twenty-four hours or more. The first bowel movement or two will be black or dark green and very slimy. It is meconium, a substance that fills the infant's intestines before she is born. If your baby does not pass meconium in the first forty-eight hours, further evaluation is required to make sure that no problems exist in the lower bowel. \n Blood in stool. On occasion, newborns have a little blood in their bowel movements. If it occurs during the first few days, it usually means the infant has a little crack in the anus from stooling. This is generally harmless, but even so, let your pediatrician know about any signs of blood to confirm the reason, since there are other causes that require further evaluation and treatment. \n \n Coughing \n \n If the baby drinks very fast, she may cough and sputter; but this type of coughing should stop as soon as her feeding routine becomes familiar. This may also be related to how strongly or fast a breastfeeding mom's milk comes down. If she coughs persistently or routinely gags during feedings, consult the pediatrician. These symptoms could indicate an underlying problem in the lungs or digestive tract. \n \n Excessive crying \n \n All newborns cry, often for no apparent reason. If you've made sure that your baby is fed, burped, warm, and dressed in a clean diaper, the best tactic is probably to hold her and talk or sing to her until she stops. You cannot spoil a baby this age by giving her too much attention. If this doesn't work, wrap her snugly in a blanket or try some other ways that may help calm your baby. \n You'll become accustomed to your baby's patterns of crying. If it ever sounds peculiar—such as shrieks of pain—or if it persists for an unusual length of time, it could mean a medical problem. Call the pediatrician and ask for advice. \n \n Forceps marks \n \n When forceps are used during ddelivery, they can leave red marks or even superficial scrapes on a newborn's face and head. These generally disappear within a few days. Sometimes a firm, flat lump develops in one of these areas because of minor damage to the tissue under the skin, but this, too, will usually go away within two months. \n \n Jaundice \n \n Many normal, healthy newborns have a yellowish tinge to their skin, which is known as jaundice. It is caused by a buildup of bilirubin in the child's blood. Mild jaundice is harmless. However, if the bilirubin level continues to rise and is not treated, it can lead to brain injury. Jaundice tends to be more common in breastfed newborns, most often in those not nursing well; breastfeeding mothers should nurse at least eight to twelve times per day, which will produce enough milk and keep bilirubin levels low. \n Jaundice first appears on the face, then the chest and abdomen, and finally the arms and legs in some instances. The whites of the eyes may also be yellow. Most hospitals now routinely screen newborns for jaundice twenty-four hours after birth using a painless handheld light meter. If the pediatrician suspects jaundice may be present—based on skin color as well as the baby's age and other factors—she may order a skin or blood test to definitively diagnose the condition. If jaundice develops before the baby is twenty-four hours old, a bil­irubin test is always needed to make an accurate diagnosis. If you notice a sudden increase in jaundice when your baby is at home, contact your pediatri­cian. \n \n Lethargy & sleepiness \n \n Every newborn spends most of her time sleeping. As long as she wakes every few hours, eats well, seems content, and is alert part of the day, it's perfectly normal to sleep the rest of the time. But if she's rarely alert, does not wake up on her own for feedings, or seems too tired or uninterested to eat, you should consult your pediatrician. This lethargy—especially if it's a sudden change in her usual pattern—may be a symptom of a serious illness. \n \n Respiratory distress \n \n It may take your baby a few hours after birth to form a normal breathing pattern, but then she should have no further difficulties. If she seems to be breathing in an unusual manner, it is most often due to blocked nasal passages. Using saline nasal drops, followed by suctioning the mucus from the nose with a bulb syringe, may fix the problem; both are available over the counter. \n However, if your newborn shows any of the following warning signs, no­tify your pediatrician immediately: \n -Fast breathing (more than sixty breaths in one minute), although keep in mind that babies normally breathe more rapidly than adults \n -Retractions (sucking in the muscles between the ribs with each breath, so that her ribs stick out) \n  -Flaring of her nose \n -Grunting while breathing \n -Persistent blue skin coloring \n \n Umbilical cord problems \n \n Umbilical stump bleeding. As you're caring for your baby's umbilical cord, you may notice a few drops of blood on the diaper around the time the stump falls off. This is normal. But if the cord actively bleeds, call your baby's doctor immediately. If the stump becomes infected, it will require medical treatment. Although cord infections are uncommon, you should contact your doctor if you notice any of the following: \n -Foul-smelling yellowish discharge from the cord \n -Red skin around the base of the cord \n -Crying when you touch the cord or the skin next to it \n \n Umbilical granuloma. Sometimes instead of completely drying, the cord will form a granuloma or a small, reddened mass of scar tissue that stays on the belly button after the umbilical cord has fallen off. This granuloma will drain a light-yellowish fluid. This condition will usually go away in about a week, but if not, your pediatrician may need to burn off (cauterize) the granulomatous tissue. \n Umbilical hernia. If your baby's umbilical cord area seems to push outward when she cries, she may have an umbilical hernia—a small hole in the muscular part of the abdominal wall that allows the tissue to bulge out when there is increased abdominal pressure (i.e., crying). This is not a serious condition, and it usually heals by itself in the first twelve to eighteen months. (For unknown reasons it often takes longer to heal in African American babies.) In the unlikely event it doesn't heal by three to five years of age, the hole may need surgery. Don't put tape or a coin on the navel. It will not help the hernia, and it may cause a skin rash.",
